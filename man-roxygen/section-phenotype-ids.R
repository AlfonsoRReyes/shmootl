#' @section Phenotype IDs:
#' 
#' A phenotype ID can be any valid item ID (see
#' \link[=shmootl-package]{package overview}), although it may be changed by
#' \pkg{R/qtl} to ensure that it is syntactically valid. In such cases, the
#' original phenotype ID can be obtained from the \code{'info'} attribute of
#' a \code{cross} that has been loaded with \code{\link{readCrossCSV}}
#' (see \code{\linkS4class{CrossInfo}}).
