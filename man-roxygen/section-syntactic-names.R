#' @section Syntactic Names:
#' 
#' A syntactically valid R name contains only letters, numbers, dots, and
#' underscores. The name should start with a letter, or a dot that is not
#' followed by a number. In addition, specific reserved words are not
#' permitted. Many R packages and functions automatically render item names
#' syntactically valid, so for example, a phenotype name may be changed when
#' added to an \pkg{R/qtl} \code{cross} object. For more information, see the
#' relevant \href{https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html}{R documentation}.
#' See also the base R function \code{make.names}.
