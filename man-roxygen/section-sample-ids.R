#' @section Sample IDs:
#' 
#' A sample ID can be any valid item ID (see
#' \link[=shmootl-package]{package overview}). Duplicate sample IDs are
#' permissible, but only if referring to replicate samples of the same strain.
#' Different strains can have different numbers of replicates, but samples from
#' a given strain must be in consecutive rows.
