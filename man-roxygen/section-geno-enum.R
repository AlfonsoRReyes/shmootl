#' @section Enumerated Alleles/Genotypes:
#' 
#' An enumerated allele/genotype is a number representing the order of
#' occurrence of raw or founder genotypes at a specific marker (e.g. \code{'1'}
#' for the first observed allele, \code{'2'} for the second). Enumerated alleles
#' and genotypes are identical, regardless of ploidy. The process of enumerating
#' genotypes is done independently for each marker, so a given enumerated
#' genotype does not have the same meaning across markers.
