#' @section Founder Alleles and Genotypes:
#' 
#' A founder allele is a single letter corresponding to a specific founder
#' strain, indicating that the region containing the marker derives from that
#' founder. For example, \code{'W'} might be used to represent the Western
#' Africa founder strain \code{DBVPG6044}, or \code{'S'} might be used for
#' the Sake strain \code{Y12}).
#' 
#' For a given ploidy \code{N}, a founder genotype is the concatenation of the
#' set of \code{N} founder alleles. For example, given one founder allele
#' \code{'W'} and another \code{'S'}, the founder genotype is \code{'WS'}.
