\section{Founder Alleles and Genotypes}{


A founder allele is a single letter corresponding to a specific founder
strain, indicating that the region containing the marker derives from that
founder. For example, \code{'W'} might be used to represent the Western
Africa founder strain \code{DBVPG6044}, or \code{'S'} might be used for
the Sake strain \code{Y12}).

For a given ploidy \code{N}, a founder genotype is the concatenation of the
set of \code{N} founder alleles. For example, given one founder allele
\code{'W'} and another \code{'S'}, the founder genotype is \code{'WS'}.
