\section{Enumerated Alleles/Genotypes}{


An enumerated allele/genotype is a number representing the order of
occurrence of raw or founder genotypes at a specific marker (e.g. \code{'1'}
for the first observed allele, \code{'2'} for the second). Enumerated alleles
and genotypes are identical, regardless of ploidy. The process of enumerating
genotypes is done independently for each marker, so a given enumerated
genotype does not have the same meaning across markers.
}

\section{Founder Alleles and Genotypes}{


A founder allele is a single letter corresponding to a specific founder
strain, indicating that the region containing the marker derives from that
founder. For example, \code{'W'} might be used to represent the Western
Africa founder strain \code{DBVPG6044}, or \code{'S'} might be used for
the Sake strain \code{Y12}).

For a given ploidy \code{N}, a founder genotype is the concatenation of the
set of \code{N} founder alleles. For example, given one founder allele
\code{'W'} and another \code{'S'}, the founder genotype is \code{'WS'}.
